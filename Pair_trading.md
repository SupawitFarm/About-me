## Introduction
Pair trading strategy is a market-neutral approach used in quantitative trading, where two highly correlated securities are bought and sold simultaneously. This strategy capitalizes on temporary dislocations in the relationship between the pair, banking on a reversion to their historical mean. It requires significant data analysis and risk management, with the flexibility to be applied across different markets and asset types. Overall, it's a sophisticated strategy aimed at exploiting market inefficiencies through rigorous quantitative analysis
